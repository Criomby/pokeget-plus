# Other Projects

Please note some of these might not be maintained.

## [pokemon-colorscripts](https://gitlab.com/phoneybadger/pokemon-colorscripts/)

It's changed quite a bit since I last looked at it.
It's now written in python, and many of my previous issues with it have been fixed.

It actually uses the same sprite database that pokeget does, which is quite cool.
It still requires the actual sprite files be on your machine, so it isn't very portable.

## [pokeshell](https://github.com/acxz/pokeshell)

It suffers from blurry sprites at times due to using timg, which wasn't designed for pixel art.

Other than that, it's still extremely feature rich with animations and a lot of extremely cool stuff.

## [krabby](https://github.com/yannjor/krabby)

Krabby is also written in rust, but it isn't very fast and can't display multiple sprites at once.

Although it has a random shiny option, which in my opinion is absolutely awesome.
